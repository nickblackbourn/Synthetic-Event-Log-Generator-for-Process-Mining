# variables.txt for Synthetic Event Log Generator
#
# This file defines the process, deviations, attributes, and variants for synthetic event log generation.
#
# New CLI options (see README):
#   --shuffle-fraction: Fraction of cases to shuffle activities for realism (default: 0.2)
#   --deviation-at-end: If set, deviations are always inserted at the end of the activity sequence
#   --random-seed: Set for reproducible results
#   --max-activities: Maximum number of activities per case (default: 8)
#
# By default, the generator preserves variant order for most cases, but you can increase realism by adjusting these options.
