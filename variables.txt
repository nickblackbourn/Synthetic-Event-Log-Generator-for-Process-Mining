# Order-to-Cash process for B2B sales
# Scenario: A B2B company processes customer orders with credit checks, picking, packing, shipping, invoicing, and payment. Deviations and variants illustrate real-world complexity for process mining analysis.

Context: Order-to-Cash process for B2B sales

Activities:
Receive Order
Check Credit

# Deviations (with plausible business logic)
# - Late Payment: Customer pays invoice late (after Send Invoice)
# - Order Change: Customer requests change after approval but before picking
# - Partial Shipment: Only part of the order is shipped (after picking)
Deviations:
Late Payment: 0.15 | after=Send Invoice
Order Change: 0.10 | before=Pick Items
Partial Shipment: 0.05 | after=Pick Items
