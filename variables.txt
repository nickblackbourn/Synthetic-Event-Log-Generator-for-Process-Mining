# variables.txt for Synthetic Event Log Generator
#
# This file defines the process, deviations, attributes, and variants for synthetic event log generation.
#
# New CLI options (see README):
#   --shuffle-fraction: Fraction of cases to shuffle activities for realism (default: 0.2)
#   --deviation-at-end: If set, deviations are always inserted at the end of the activity sequence
#   --random-seed: Set for reproducible results
#   --max-activities: Maximum number of activities per case (default: 8)
#
# By default, the generator preserves variant order for most cases, but you can increase realism by adjusting these options.
#
# SECTION EXAMPLES:
#
# Context:
#   Order-to-Cash process for B2B sales
#
# Activities:
#   Receive Order
#   Check Credit
#   Approve Order
#   ...
#
# Deviations:
#   Late Payment: 0.15
#   Order Change: 0.10
#   ...
#
# CaseAttributes:
#   CustomerType: New, Returning, VIP
#   Region: North, South, East, West
#
# EventAttributes:
#   Resource: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave
#   Channel: Email, Phone, Web
#
# Variants:
#   Standard: Receive Order, Check Credit, Approve Order, ... | 0.7
#   Express: Receive Order, Pick Items, ... | 0.1
#
# DemoPatterns:
#   # Bottleneck: Pack Items takes longer for VIP customers
#   # Rework: Pick Items repeated if Order Change occurs

# Define the process context (optional, for documentation)
Context:
Order-to-Cash process for B2B sales

# List the main activities in the process
Activities:
Receive Order
Check Credit
Approve Order
Pick Items
Pack Items
Ship Order
Send Invoice
Receive Payment

# Define deviations and their per-case probabilities (0.0-1.0)
# You can specify where the deviation should occur using | before=<activity/sequence> or | after=<activity/sequence>
# Only one placement modifier ('before' or 'after') is allowed per deviation.
# For sequences, use comma-separated activities (no spaces).
# Examples:
# Late Payment: 0.15 | after=Send Invoice
# Order Change: 0.10 | before=Pick Items
# Partial Shipment: 0.05 | after=Approve Order,Pick Items
Deviations:
Late Payment: 0.15 | after=Send Invoice
Order Change: 0.10 | before=Pick Items
Partial Shipment: 0.05 | after=Approve Order,Pick Items

# Define case-level attributes (assigned per case)
CaseAttributes:
CustomerType: New, Returning, VIP
Region: North, South, East, West

# Define event-level attributes (assigned per event)
EventAttributes:
Resource: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave
Channel: Email, Phone, Web

# Define process variants (optional, with frequencies summing to 1.0)
Variants:
Standard: Receive Order, Check Credit, Approve Order, Pick Items, Pack Items, Ship Order, Send Invoice, Receive Payment | 0.7
No Credit Check: Receive Order, Approve Order, Pick Items, Pack Items, Ship Order, Send Invoice, Receive Payment | 0.2
Express: Receive Order, Pick Items, Pack Items, Ship Order, Send Invoice, Receive Payment | 0.1

# DemoPatterns:
#   # Bottleneck: Pack Items takes longer for VIP customers
#   # Rework: Pick Items repeated if Order Change occurs
